# AI Team Features - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the AI Team features implemented in the GeoCMS frontend, which transform the system from a task management tool into an **AI Content Team collaboration platform**.

## Core Concept

The system now presents AI Agents as **virtual team members** with distinct roles, personalities, and work schedules, making AI work visible, understandable, and trustworthy.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Agent Configuration System

**Location**: `src/lib/constants/agents.ts`

Defines four AI agents with unique identities:

- **Knowledge Manager** (Blue) - Manages brand knowledge base
- **Content Planner** (Purple) - Creates content plans
- **Content Writer** (Orange) - Generates content drafts
- **Quality Verifier** (Green) - Checks content quality

Each agent has:
- Unique icon and color scheme
- Role description
- Work schedule
- Trigger conditions

### 2. Core Components

#### AgentAvatar (`src/components/team/AgentAvatar.tsx`)
- Visual representation of agents
- Shows agent status with animated indicators
- Three sizes: sm, md, lg

#### AgentBadge (`src/components/team/AgentBadge.tsx`)
- Compact agent identifier
- Used throughout the UI to show agent attribution
- Two sizes with optional icon

#### AgentStatusChip (`src/components/team/AgentStatusChip.tsx`)
- Quick status indicator for agents
- Shows active task count
- Clickable link to Team page

#### AgentCard (`src/components/team/AgentCard.tsx`)
- Detailed agent information card
- Shows current task, queue, and performance metrics
- Displays work schedule and triggers

#### TeamStatusBar (`src/components/team/TeamStatusBar.tsx`)
- Quick overview of all agents
- Real-time status updates
- Displayed on main dashboard

#### ActivityTimeline (`src/components/team/ActivityTimeline.tsx`)
- Chronological feed of all activities
- Shows agent attribution for each action
- Distinguishes between agent and user actions
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

### 3. New Pages

#### AI Team Dashboard (`/dashboard/team`)
**Location**: `src/app/dashboard/team/page.tsx`

Features:
- Team statistics (members, active agents, queued tasks, completed today)
- Agent cards grid showing detailed status for each agent
- Recent activity timeline
- Real-time updates every 3 seconds

#### Activity Timeline (`/dashboard/activity`)
**Location**: `src/app/dashboard/activity/page.tsx`

Features:
- Complete activity feed
- Filter by status (all, active, completed, failed)
- Filter by agent
- Search functionality
- Activity statistics
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

### 4. Enhanced Existing Pages

#### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Added TeamStatusBar at the top
- Shows all agents' current status
- Added Recent Activity section
- Links to Team and Activity pages

#### Active Tasks Summary
- Now shows agent badges for each task
- Displays which agent is working on what
- More descriptive task status

#### Task Monitor (`/dashboard/tasks`)
- Agent badges in task timeline
- Clear attribution of tasks to agents
- Enhanced task details with agent information

### 5. Navigation Updates

Added two new navigation items:
- **AI Team** - View team dashboard
- **Activity** - View activity timeline

---

## Type Definitions

**Location**: `src/types/index.ts`

New types added:
```typescript
export type AgentId = 'knowledge' | 'planner' | 'writer' | 'verifier'
export type AgentStatus = 'active' | 'idle' | 'scheduled' | 'waiting'

export interface AgentStatusData {
  agentId: AgentId
  status: AgentStatus
  currentTask?: {
    id: number
    type: string
    startedAt: string
  }
  queuedTasks: number
  nextScheduledTime?: string
  todayCompleted: number
}

export interface ActivityItem {
  id: number
  type: 'agent' | 'user' | 'system'
  actor: {
    id: string
    name: string
    avatar?: string
  }
  action: string
  target: {
    type: 'knowledge' | 'plan' | 'draft' | 'task'
    id: number
    title: string
  }
  timestamp: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}
```

## Design System

### Color Scheme

Each agent has a consistent color scheme:

- **Knowledge Manager**: Blue (#3B82F6)
- **Content Planner**: Purple (#8B5CF6)
- **Content Writer**: Orange (#F59E0B)
- **Quality Verifier**: Green (#10B981)

### Status Colors

- **Active**: Green (with pulse animation)
- **Idle**: Yellow
- **Scheduled**: Blue
- **Waiting**: Gray

### Visual Consistency

- All agent-related UI elements use the same color scheme
- Consistent iconography across the application
- Unified badge and chip designs
- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes

---

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Transparency
- Users can see exactly what each agent is doing
- Clear attribution of AI-generated content
- Real-time status updates

### 2. Trust
- Agents have consistent identities
- Work schedules are visible
- Performance metrics are tracked

### 3. Collaboration
- Clear distinction between user and agent actions
- Activity timeline shows the full story
- Easy to understand workflow

### 4. Efficiency
- Quick access to team status from dashboard
- Filter and search capabilities
- Real-time updates without page refresh

---

## Technical Implementation

### Real-time Updates

- Team status: 3-second polling
- Activity timeline: 5-second polling
- Task monitor: 3-second polling
- Uses React Query for efficient data fetching

### Performance

- Optimized component rendering
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Efficient state management
- Build size optimized

### Accessibility

- Semantic HTML
- ARIA labels where needed

## ðŸ’¡ Key Principles

1. **Clean Backlog**: Only pending tasks, no completed items
2. **Clear Priorities**: P0 > P1 > P2 > P3
3. **Regular Updates**: Weekly during sprint, at sprint end
4. **Historical Record**: All completed work in CHANGELOG
5. **Actionable Tasks**: Each task has clear subtasks and effort

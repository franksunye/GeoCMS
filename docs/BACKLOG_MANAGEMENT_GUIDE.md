## 📋 Backlog Structure

### Three Key Documents

#### 1. **00_BACKLOG.md** (Current Work)
- Contains **only pending tasks**
- Organized by sprint (Sprint 2, 3, 4, etc.)
- Tasks marked with `[ ]` (pending) or `[x]` (completed)
- Updated weekly during sprint reviews
- **Never contains completed sprints** - they move to CHANGELOG

#### 2. **01_CHANGELOG.md** (Completed Work)
- Contains **all completed sprints**
- Organized by version (v0.4, v0.3.1, etc.)
- Detailed list of what was delivered
- Includes dates and impact metrics
- **Historical record of progress**

#### 3. **00_ROADMAP.md** (Product Vision)
- High-level product direction
- Quarter-by-quarter planning
- Strategic goals and milestones
- Links to detailed backlog
